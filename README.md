# So-101 Dataset
The dataset comprises **20** episodes of high-quality teleoperated robotic arm recordings at ~**30** FPS. It is a compact, curated set captured using **multi-view cameras** (front, wrist, top) within the calibrated robot studio of the **SO-101 arm**, leveraging the **LeRobot** framework. Specifically designed for **imitation learning** and model training on the LeRobot platform, this dataset demonstrates **basic manipulation** and **pick-and-place tasks** with structured LeRobot v2.1 annotations.

By utilizing this robotic dataset, researchers and developers can advance evaluation of **pretrained models**, address issues in setups, and explore calibrations for **robotics applications** facing real-world tasks. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/lerobot-so-101-manipulations/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=lerobot-so-101-manipulations)**

Its core purpose is to support imitation learning, model training, and the evaluation of pretrained models.
This compact set of 20 teleoperated robotic arm recordings is designed for imitation learning, model training, and training models on the lerobot platform, demonstrating pick-and-place and basic manipulation tasks with structured LeRobot v2.1 annotations across robots, arms, platforms, frameworks, and tools.
